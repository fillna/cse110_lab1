# Jun Linwu's User Page

Hello everyone. My name is Jun Linwu and I am a third-year student majoring in Data Science. My motivation of taking this course is to gain some industry-like group project experience as a software engineer. As a data science student, I'm very familiar in using Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also a little bit of C++. One fun fact about my favorite programming language is that my username is actually inspired by one of the function in Python's pandas library -- `.fillna()`. Iâ€™m looking forward to meet you all :)
